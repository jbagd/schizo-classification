Kaggle competition: Diagnose schizophrenia using multimodal features from MRI scans
http://www.kaggle.com/c/mlsp-2014-mri

"This competition invites you to automatically diagnose subjects with schizophrenia based on multimodal features derived from their brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

The features made available in this competition are a result from current state-of-the art developments in neuroimaging and MRI data processing. Two modalities of MRI scans are used to obtain these features: functional and structural MRI. One challenge in this competition is how to optimally combine this type of multimodal information and select features that enhance diagnosis."

Contents of the repository are several scripts written in R. "trial3.R" appeared to give best results.
